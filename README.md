### Workflow:  
1. pull changes from `devel`  
2. commit your own changes and push them to _your own_ branch  
- create a merge request from your branch to `devel`  
- once the merge request is approved, `devel` will be up to date   
- when the project reaches its final stage, it will be merged to `main`
